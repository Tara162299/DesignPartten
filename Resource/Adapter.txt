Use the adapter design parttern when:
- Want to reuse the existing code with similar functions
- But the two sources are not compatitble to each other, for example, the interfaces of the old code and the newly required one are not compatible
=> Use an adapter class that implement the new interface, then have a "transfer" method that modify the "Set" methods of the adapter class
